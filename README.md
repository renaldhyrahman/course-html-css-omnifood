## Git Workflow (Learning phase)

I keep `main` clean and production-ready.  
All work is done in feature branches and merged into `dev` during development.  
Each section or feature has its own descriptive, encapsulated branch.  
Commit messages follow the **Conventional Commits** format for clarity.  
Merges use `--no-ff` to preserve full history.  
Merged branches are deleted to keep things clean.

I made the mistake of mixing CLI merges and GitHub PRs for `dev` â†’ `main`, which caused some overlap.  
I'll stick to a single method moving forward.

This is a learning project. Feedback is always welcome!
