## Git Workflow (Learning phase)

I keep `main` clean and production-ready.  
All development happens in feature branches and is merged into `dev` during development.  
Each section or feature lives in its own clearly named, encapsulated branch.
Commit messages follow the **Conventional Commits** format for clarity.  
I use `--no-ff` merges to preserve the full commit history.  
Merged branches are deleted to keep the repo tidy.

I once mixed CLI merges and GitHub PRs for `dev` â†’ `main`, which led to some overlap in history. 
Going forward, Iâ€™ll stick to a single method to avoid confusion.

This is a learning project â€” feedback is always welcome!
